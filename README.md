## Inspiration
We have to search on Google every time we want to know about Hotels, Restaurants, and Attractions if we are traveling somewhere. The results are also not filtered as we want. This led us to make such an application where we can search anyplace in the whole world which tell us about its all hotels, restaurants and attractions and filter according to ratings given by other people. 
## What it does
Yaatrigan tell about all the Hotels, Restaurants and Attractions of your current location or you can search your preferred place. We can adjust the area in the map according to ourselves and it will list all the places in that area. We can filter the Hotels, Restaurants and Attractions according to the ratings given by other tourists as per their experience there. It also lists the achievements and Awards of Hotels and Restaurants achieved by them so far. It also lists the price range for the respective place. Added Alan AI to interact and know weather for any location you are traveling or staying by voioice commands.
